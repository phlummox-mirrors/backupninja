  #2405)

### handler changes

- Options passed to mysqldump are now customizable with the new sqldumpoptions
  configuration variable. Thanks to Chris Lamb for his preliminary patch
  (Closes: DEBBUG-502966)
- Hide 'mysqladmin ping' output, to prevent confusing the user in case mysqld
  is running but the authentication fails, which apparently does not prevent
  mysqldump to work.

  indeed returns 0 when authentication fails.
- Use gzip's --rsyncable option.
- Quote output filenames to support shell meta-characters in database names.

#### dup

- General cleanup
- Better support for new duplicity (>= 0.4.4) command line syntax: run
  remove-older-than when $keep is not set to yes (Closes: DEBBUG-458816), and run
  "duplicity cleanup" before any other duplicity command; both only trigger a
  warning on failure, since they should not stop backups from being done. Also
  migrated full/incremental backup switch to the new syntax.
- Support every duplicity-supported transport with new configuration option
  desturl (Closes: DEBBUG-483712, DEBBUG-346040, Trac#2).
- Actually allow to backup only VServers, by relaxing $include test.

- Fixed ignore_version default value missing
- Add patch from Matthew Palmer to rdiff handler to incorporate sshoptions into
  options via remote-schema not already specified (Closes: DEBBUG-424639)

#### wget

- New handler from rhatto designed to incrementally pull content from a website
  to a local folder, based on the rsync handler

#### maildir

- fixed bug where maildirs that start with a number were skipped
- make maildir helper look in every subdirectory of the source directory for
  maildirs, rather than just looking in the directories [a-zA-Z0-9], thanks for
  the patch from chris@cenolan.com (Trac#43).
- make deleted maildirs record the date they were deleted
- add destid_file configuration option to enable you to specify an alternate
  ssh public key authentication file (defaulting to /root/.ssh/id_rsa) pgsql,
  mysql, svn, sys:
- use new vservers_running function from lib/vserver (factorization++)

#### sys

- update for 2.6 kernels: use /proc/kallsyms instead of /proc/ksyms (Closes:
  Trac#39)
- support selection of VServers to run on, in the same way as in the dup
  handler, with the new vsnames configuration option ; (Closes: Trac#45)
- add support for capturing the package debconf selection states using
  debconf-get-selections
- fixed catifexec function to actually work, also now passes the arguments
  given to catifexec() to the called command (Thanks John Hallam!)
- Added more robust software RAID information capture by running mdadm -Q
  --detail /dev/md?\* because some people may have empty mdadm.conf files
  (Thanks to John Hallam).

#### trac

- stop failing on all the trac backups if just one fails, this means removing
  the temporary trac backup directories if they fail

#### makecd

- updated handler for new toolset (genisoimage and wodim)

## [0.9.5] - 2007-12-02

### backupninja changes

- Fixed checks on configuration files permissions, since the patch applied to
  fix DEBBUG-370396 broke this, especially for configuration files created with
  permissions 000 by an older ninjahelper version.

- Added quoting because it was needed to prevent shell expansion, broking the
  toint function sometimes (Closes: Trac#11)
- Fixed reportspace option (Closes: Trac#10)
- Fixed ldap handler not recognizing database suffix (Closes: Trac#28)

### handler changes

#### dup

- Support duplicity >= 0.4.3 invocation syntax (--ssh-command option is not
  supported anymore) (Closes: DEBBUG-447425)
- New tmpdir configuration option, very useful in case duplicity tends to fill
  up /tmp.

#### ldap

- Fixed shell command quoting issues, missing 'then' clauses, cleaned up
  compress=yes to be less redundant and not create empty uncompressed file
  (Closes: DEBBUG-394935)
- Fixed ninjahelper to properly set compress option, standardized on yes/no
  instead of on/off
- Fixed problem that caused combination of slapcat and compress to not work
  together (Closes: Trac#29)

- Added an examples file (Closes: Trac#23)
- Applied patch from Anarcat that fixes the cp/mkdir calls to not use GNU
  coreutils options, as well as some bashisms (Closes: Trac#24)
- Fix test mode (Closes: Trac#25)

#### mysql

- Fixed case where odd combination of configuration options caused sqldump
  backups to get overwritten with an empty file (Closes: DEBBUG-402679)
- Added 'nodata' option to enable you to specify tables that you want to omit
  the data from a backup, but still backup the table structure. This is very
  useful in cases where tables contain large amounts of cache data. See the
  example.mysql for options, thanks Daniel Bonniot (Closes: DEBBUG-408829)
- Enhance code for selecting databases by asking MySQL not to give us the
  header (-N), to not draw pretty boxes around the output (-B), send the query
  via -e instead of a pipe and ensure MySQL listens to -B. Thanks to Matthew
  Palmer (Closes: DEBBUG-452039).

#### pgsql

- Support configuring PGSQLUSER for real, and document it a bit; this broken
  support actually prevented pgsql handler to work for VServers (Closes:
  DEBBUG-396578)

#### rdiff-backup

- Added cstream support to allow for bandwidth limiting
- Handle "keep = yes" to disable old backups removal (Closes: DEBBUG-424633)
- Add configuration option to allow you to disable the version check as in some
  instances this may be an ok scenario (Closes: DEBBUG-424632)

  (Closes: DEBBUG-440554)
- Added example.rsync configuration file

#### sys

- Fixed typo breaking things for VServers.
- Fix bug when vrootdir is on its own partition (Closes: DEBBUG-395928)
- Better sfdisk error and output handling: should now properly warn when it
  does not manage to backup a partition table, and shut up when it succeeds
  (Closes: DEBBUG-396632)
- Added option to not use sfdisk at all, useful for vserver/xen instances that
  produce warnings about no harddisks found (Closes: DEBBUG-404071)
- Fixed example in example.sys to detail the `__star__` in partitionsfile and
  note why its necessary (Closes: DEBBUG-409192)
- Force C locale for sfdisk to ensure english words are found in grep
- Make directory where output is placed configurable, and create the parent dir
  if it doesn't exist (Closes: Trac#1)

#### ninjareport

- Added first draft of method to aggregate reports from many servers into one
  email. Requires logtail, rsync, configuration of reporthost, reportdirectory
  and reportuser in backupninja.conf. Configure cron to run once a day, and
  individual backupninjas not to report by email their status, then enjoy one
  email report from all hosts, rather than multiple

- fixed 'make install' bug that failed if /etc/backup.d already existed
- changed spaces to tabs in Makefile.am
- updated redhat spec file (thanks Adam Monsen)

## [0.9.4] - 2006-10-06

### backupninja changes

- Fixed bug in toint(), and thus isnow(), which caused it to not work when run
  from cron.
- Recursively ignore subdirs in /etc/backup.d (Closes: DEBBUG-361102)
- Add admingroup option to configuration to allow a group that can read/write
  configurations (instead of only allowing root). Checks and complains about
  group-readable files only when the group differs from the one in the
  configuration file (default is root as before).  Thanks to Martin Krafft for
  the patch (Closes: DEBBUG-370396).
- When determining which backup actions to make, find now follows symlinks for
  $configdirectory
- Changed order of -s to mail for compatibility
- fixed permission stat call so it uses the --format supported by coreutils
  (Closes: DEBBUG-382747)
- Added disk space report option (thanks Adam Kosmin)

### handler changes

#### Added tar handler

- create tarballs

- rotated rsync snapshops
- code from paulv@bikkel.org

- alternative to rsnap
- code from rhatto@riseup.net

#### mysql

- Fixed improper use of $vuserhome (Closes: DEBBUG-351083)
- Fixed erroneous removal of tmpfile when it didn't exit
- Fixed inversed vsname emptiness check
- Fixed su quote usage to be more posixy
- Compress for sqldumps now happens in-line to save some disk space (Closes:
  DEBBUG-370778)

#### pgsql

- Fixed inversed vsname emptiness check
- Fixed su quote usage to be more posixy

- postgres user UID is now the one from inside the vserver if necessary
- Compress now happens in-line to save some disk space (Closes: DEBBUG-370778)
- $PGSQLUSER is used instead of hardcoding user 'postgres' (although this is
  the default)

#### svn

- Fixed inversed vsname emptiness check

#### rdiff

- Symlink and globbing support in include/exclude/vsinclude. Clarification:
  globbing is fully supported again, whereas no attempt is done to dereference
  symlinks anymore, due to incompatibilities between various readlink versions
  in this field.
- Removed overzealous vsnames check
- Now works if testconnect=no and if $test is not defined.
- add $sshoptions config parameter in [dest] section of config so connections
  to ports other than 22 can be made by adding the following to the top of the
  handler config: options = --remote-schema 'ssh -p REMOTE-PORT -C %s
  rdiff-backup --server'

#### dup

- Symlink and globbing support in include/exclude/vsinclude. Clarification
  globbing is fully supported again, whereas no attempt is done to dereference
  symlinks anymore, due to incompatibilities between various readlink versions
  in this field.
- Removed over zealous vsnames check
- Does not pretend anymore that duplicity can work without any passphrase
- Support duplicity 0.4.2 (with Debian patches applied; upstream's 0.4.3 will
  integrate them); documented how to write sftp-compatible sshoptions (Closes:
  DEBBUG-388543)
- Now forbid to (try to) include /.

#### sys

### lib changes

#### vserver

- init_vservers: fixed DEBBUG-351083 (improper readlink syntax)
- found_vservers: escaped special grep repetition character +
- forced mktemp to use a template with a name to be more compatible with
  different versions of mktemp, thanks anarcat

### ninjahelper changes

- Recursively ignore subdirs in /etc/backup.d (Closes: DEBBUG-361102)
- Fix configdirectory error that forced you to use /etc/backup.d, thanks
  anarcat
- When determining which backup actions to list, find now follows symlinks for
  $configdirectory
- Stop checking helpers perms: both "make install" and distros packages install
  them with appropriate permissions, it's overzealous to check this at runtime,
  and is more complicated to do with current admingroup option.

#### dup.helper

- Fix: signing was enabled with symmetric encryption.

#### other

- changed cron permissions to 644
- changed /etc/backup.d permissions to 0770 (for admingroup)
- minor documentation fixes

  srpm-package' targets, also fixes permissions on man directories, cleans up
  RPM-related files during distclean, and adds default EDITOR for "autogen.sh
  -f" if none is set. (thanks Robert Napier)

  as this is safer
