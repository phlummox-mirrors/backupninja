Description: lightweight, extensible meta-backup system
 Backupninja lets you drop simple config files in /etc/backup.d to
 coordinate system backups. Backupninja is a master of many arts,
 including incremental remote filesystem backup, and MySQL backup.
 By creating simple drop-in handler scripts, backupninja can learn new skills.
 Backupninja is a silent flower blossom death strike to lost data.
 .
 In addition to backing up regular files, Backupninja has handlers to ease
 backing up: Maildir, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SVN, Trac, hardware and system
 information, as well as the output from custom shell scripts.
 .
 Backupninja currently supports common backup utilities, easing their
 configuration, currently supported are: rdiff-backup, duplicity, rsync,
 borgbackup, restic and CD/DVD.
