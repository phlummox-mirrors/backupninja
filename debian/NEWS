backupninja (1.0~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  duplicity 0.6.17 and later has moved to a new sftp/scp backend
  which no longer uses sftp/scp client programs, but instead relies on
  paramiko, a Python ssh+sftp implementation.

  Therefore, the sshoptions option of the backupninja duplicity handler
  cannot be used for anything but the one supported by this new backend:
  -oIdentityfile=some_key_file -- all other ssh options are ignored.

backupninja (0.9.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Being severely broken for ages (see #596935), LDAP support was removed upstream.
  It will come back once this code has found itself a maintainer.
  Interested? Get in touch!

backupninja (0.9.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * duplicity 0.6.01 and later defaults to using an archive (cache)
    directory, which was previously opt-in. Starting with backupninja
    0.9.8, the backupninja duplicity handler puts this cache into
    /var/cache/backupninja/duplicity unless specified by the user with
    the "options" setting the *.dup job.
    When backups have been performed with backupninja older than 0.9.8 in
    conjunction with duplicity 0.6.01 or later, e.g. when using Sid or
    Squeeze at certain times of the Squeeze release cycle, cache files
    were probably saved into /root/.cache/duplicity; one may want to
    delete these files, or rather save bandwidth and just move the cache
    directory to the new location:

      mkdir -p /var/cache/backupninja
      mv /root/.cache/duplicity /var/cache/backupninja/

    It is probably desirable to exclude this cache directory from
    duplicity backup sets to avoid some kind of reentrant backup problem.

backupninja (0.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * duplicity: Old (pre-0.9.4) example.dup file used to give false
    information about the way the GnuPG-related options are used.
    Please read the new /usr/share/doc/backupninja/examples/example.dup
    file, and update your own configuration files if needed.

  * duplicity, rdiff: symlinks and globbing support in
    include/exclude/vsinclude was unclear and did not work in all
    situations, with weird behavious, due to incompatibilities
    between various readlink versions in this field. This has been made
    clear eventually: globbing is fully supported again, whereas no
    attempt is done to dereference symlinks anymore.
    Please read the new /usr/share/doc/backupninja/examples/example.dup
    or /usr/share/doc/backupninja/examples/example.rdiff file, and update
    your own configuration files if needed.

  * duplicity: duplicity now uses sftp, which does not support all scp
    command line options; you thus have to convert the sshoptions setting
    in your *.dup configuration files, to sftp-compatible syntax; for
    example, you can replace:
      sshoptions = -i /root/.ssh/id_dsa_duplicity
    with:
      sshoptions = -o IdentityFile=/root/.ssh/id_dsa_duplicity

backupninja (0.9.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  WARNING FOR DUPLICITY USERS

  Old (pre-0.9.2) example.dup file used to give false information about the way
  the GnuPG-related options are used. Please read the new example.dup file, and
  update your own configuration files if needed.
