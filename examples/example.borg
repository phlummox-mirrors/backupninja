## This is an example borgbackup configuration file.
##
## Here you can find all the possible borgbackup options, details of
## what the options provide and possible settings. The defaults are set
## as the commented out option, uncomment and change when
## necessary. Options which are uncommented in this example do not have
## defaults, and the settings provided are recommended.
##
## The defaults are useful in most cases, just make sure to configure the
## destination host and user.
##

## default is 0, but set to 19 if you want to lower the priority.
## an example setting would be:
## nicelevel = 19
##
## Default
# nicelevel = 0

## ionicelevel is optional. If it is left undefined or empty, ionice will not
## be used at all. If it is set to to an integer value from 0 to 7, then ionice
## will be used with the best effort class (-c2) and with the ionicelevel as
## the class data (-n).
##
## See the ionice(1) man page for more details about available levels.
##
## Default:
# ionicelevel =

## default is yes. set to no to skip the test if the remote host is alive
##
## Default:
# testconnect = yes

## default is not to limit bandwidth.
## set to a number in kiBytes/second to limit bandwidth usage.
##
## Default:
# bwlimit = 0

## default is to initialize the backup repository if absent
## set to no to skip this step
##
## Default:
# init = yes

## A few notes about includes and excludes:
## 1. include paths do not support any kind of pattern matching
## 2. exclude paths support several types of pattern matching, the default being
##    shell-style matching, where, for example, '*' matches any number of
##    characters. for more info, see : borg help patterns
## 3. Symlinks are preserved (not followed).
##
## for more info see : borg help patterns
##
## files to include in the backup
include = /opt
include = /srv
include = /etc
include = /root
include = /home
include = /usr/local
include = /var

## files to exclude from the backup
exclude = /var/lock
exclude = /var/run
exclude = /var/cache
exclude = /var/tmp
exclude = /var/lib/mongodb/journal
exclude = /var/lib/clamav
exclude = /var/lib/mlocate
exclude = /var/lib/postgresql
exclude = /var/lib/mysql

## define extra command-line options for the "borg create" operation.
##
## Example:
## create_options = --exclude-caches
##
## for more info see : borg help create
##
## Default:
# create_options =

## whether to prune (remove) older backups
##
## Default:
# prune = yes

## keep all backups within this time frame.
## must be defined as a number followed by one of the
## following characters: "H", "d", "w", "m", "y"
##
## this option will be ignored if set to 0
##
## the default is to keep all backups made within the
## last 30 days
##
## Default:
# keep = 30d

## define extra command-line options for the "borg prune" operation.
##
## Example:
## prune_options = --keep-daily=7 --keep-weekly=4 --keep-monthly=6
##
## for more info see : borg help prune
##
## Default:
# prune_options =

## by default borg emits a warning when a source file or directory
## vanishes during the backup operations
## set to yes to ignore such warnings

## put the backups under this directory, this must be set!
## an example setting would be:
## directory = /backups
##
## Default:
# directory =

## the machine which will receive the backups.
## an example setting would be:
## host = backuphost
##
## set host = localhost for local backups (no ssh)

## make the files owned by this user. you must be able to

## archive name, should be unique every day.
## Format tags available :
## {now}, {utcnow}, {fqdn}, {hostname}, {user}, {pid}
##
## for more info see : borg help create

## Default:
# archive = {now:%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S}

## compression algorithm
## can be "none", "lz4", "zstd[,L]", "zlib[,L]", "lzma[,L]", "auto,C[,L]".
## - "none" stands for "no compression"
## - "lz4" offers very high speed, very low compression
## - "zstd" is a modern wide-range algorithm
## - "zlib" offers medium speed, medium compression
## - "lzma" offers low speed, high compression
## - "auto,C" will use a heuristic to decide whether to compress using
##            selected algorithm C
##
## for more info see : borg help compression
##
## Default:
# compression = lz4

## encryption mode to use for repository creation
##
## common options are "none", "repokey" or "keyfile"
## - "none" = no encryption
## - "repokey" = encryption with key stored inside the repository
## - "keyfile" = encryption with key stored in ~/.config/borg/keys/
##
## for other options and more info, see : borg help init
##
## Default:
# encryption = none

## passphrase of the key used for repository encryptions
##
## must be set if encryption is not "none"
## encryption is disabled by default
##
## Default:
# passphrase =

## Path to the directory that will hold borg's cache files. By default this is
## empty, which will let borg use its default path of "~/.cache/borg".

## Default:
# cache_directory =

## command-line options to use with ssh

## an example setting would be:
